        was not able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target on
        an available authentication protocol. Nessus was able to connect to the remote
        port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication
        protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the
        provided credentials. There may have been a protocol failure that prevented
        authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for
        the authentication protocol may be invalid. See plugin output for error details.\n\nPlease
        note the following :\n\n- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible
        for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another.
        For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while
        no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.\n\n- Providing
        valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve
        scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol
        may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered
        from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication
        via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and
        likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows
        targets than for Linux   targets.","exploit_available":false,"exploit_framework_canvas":false,"exploit_framework_core":false,"exploit_framework_d2_elliot":false,"exploit_framework_exploithub":false,"exploit_framework_metasploit":false,"exploited_by_malware":false,"exploited_by_nessus":false,"family":"Settings","family_id":41,"has_patch":false,"id":110723,"in_the_news":false,"name":"Target

        protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the
        provided credentials. There may have been a protocol failure that prevented
        authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for
        the authentication protocol may be invalid. See plugin output for error details.\n\nPlease
        note the following :\n\n- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible
        for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another.
        For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while
        no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.\n\n- Providing
        valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve
        scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol
        may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered
        from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication
        via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and
